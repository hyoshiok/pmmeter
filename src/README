Building
---------
1. To build mgen
	cd <numatop home>/
	make test

2. To clean the built objects
	cd <numatop home>/
	make clean

Note
----
mgen is a micro-test application which can generate memory access with
runtime latency between CPUs. 

Please note the latencies reported by mgen are not the official latencies
from Intel/IBM. It is just a tool to test numatop.

For example:

1. Generate LMA for 1000s (memory allocated on node1, thread runs on cpu1):
   (cpu1 is on node1)
   ./mgen -a 1 -c 1 -t 1000

2. Generate RMA for 1000s (memory allocated on node0, thread runs on cpu10):
   (cpu10 is not on node0):
   ./mgen -a 0 -c 10 -t 1000
